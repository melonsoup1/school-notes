# Functions (advanced)
#### Odd and Even Functions:
* **Definition:** A function $f(x)$ for which $f(-x)=f(x)$ for any value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ is called an **even function** and its graph is symmetric about the y-axis
* **Definition:** A function $f(x)$ for which $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for any value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ is called an **odd function** and its graph is symmetric about the origin

#### Root Functions:
* **Definition:** The function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ with $D_f: x\ge0$ and $R_f={y\in\rm l\!R}$: $y\ge0$ is called the **square root function**
* The square root function is increasing everywhere on its domain
* **Definition:** The function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ with $D_f: x\in\rm l\!R$ and $R_f: y\in\rm l\!R$ is called the **cube root function**
* The cube root function is increasing everywhere on its domain

#### Reciprocal Function (Indirect Proportion):
* **Definition**: The function
