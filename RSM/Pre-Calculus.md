# Functions
#### Odd and Even Functions:
* **Definition:** A function $f(x)$ for which $f(-x)=f(x)$ for any value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ is called an **even function** and its graph is symmetric about the y-axis.
* **Definition:** A function $f(x)$ for which $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for any value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ is called an **odd function** and its graph is symmetric about the origin.

#### Reciprocal Functions (Indirect Proportion):
* **Definition**: The function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ with $D_f\neq0$ and $R_f\neq0$ is the **reciprocal function** or **indirect proportion**.
* The graph of function $f(x)$ is a rotated hyperbola situated in the first and third quadrants of the Cartesian plane.

#### Composition of Functions:
* A composition of functions is a combination of two or more functions embedded inside each other as a function of a function - the analytical expression of one function is substituded for $x$ into another function.
* **Definition:** The composition of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, denoted $f\circ g$, is defined as $(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$.
* The domain of $f\circ g$ is equal to the domains of $(f\circ g) \cap g(x)$

#### Inverse Functions:
* An inverse function to a function is like what addition is to subtraction.
* **Definition**: The inverse function of a function $f(x)$ is a function that undoes the operation of $f$. That is, if $f(x)$ produces $y$, then putting $y$ into the inverse of $f$ produces the output $x$. A function $f(x)$ that has an inverse is called invertible and the inverse is denoted by $f^{-1}$.
* The graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the same as $f(x)$ but reflected about the line $y=x$.
* **Horizontal Line Test:** A function is one-to-one if any horizontal line intersects the graph at exactly one point. A function satisfying the horizontal line test is invertible.
* To get an inverse function, one must:
	1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$
	2. Interchange $x$ and $y$
	3. Solve for $y$
	4. Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$
	5. Exchange domain and range

# Logarithms
#### Definition: $$\log_ba=c\leftrightarrow b^c=a$$

#### Fundamental Logarithmic Identities
$$\log_b(ac)=\log_ba+\log_bc$$
$$\log_b(\frac{a}{c})=\log_ba-\log_bc$$
$$\log_b(a^c)=c*\log_ba$$
$$\log_b1=0$$
$$\log_bb=1$$
$$\log_b(b^a)=a$$
$$b^{\log_ba}=a$$
$$\log_b(\frac{1}{a})=-\log_b(a)$$
