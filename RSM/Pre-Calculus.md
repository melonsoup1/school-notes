# Functions
#### Odd and Even Functions:
* **Definition:** A function $f(x)$ for which $f(-x)=f(x)$ for any value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ is called an **even function** and its graph is symmetric about the y-axis.
* **Definition:** A function $f(x)$ for which $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for any value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ is called an **odd function** and its graph is symmetric about the origin.

#### Root Functions:
* **Definition:** The function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ with $D_f: x\ge0$ and $R_f={y\in\rm l\!R}$: $y\ge0$ is called the **square root function**.
* The square root function is increasing everywhere on its domain.
* **Definition:** The function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ with $D_f: x\in\rm l\!R$ and $R_f: y\in\rm l\!R$ is called the **cube root function**.
* The cube root function is increasing everywhere on its domain.

#### Reciprocal Functions (Indirect Proportion):
* **Definition**: The function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ with $D_f\neq0$ and $R_f\neq0$ is the **reciprocal function** or **indirect proportion**.
* The graph of function $f(x)$ is a rotated hyperbola situated in the first and third quadrants of the Cartesian plane.

#### Absolute Value Functions:
* **Definition:** $f(x)=|x|=\begin{cases} -x, x<0\\ x, x\ge0 \end{cases}$  where $x\in\rm l\!R$ is called the **absolute value function**

#### Composition of Functions:
* A composition of functions is a combination of two or more functions embedded inside each other as a function of a function - the analytical expression of one function is substituded for $x$ into another function.
* **Definition:** The composition of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, denoted $f\circ g$, is defined as $(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$.
* The domain of $f\circ g$ is the set of all $x$'s in the domain of $g(x)$ for which the value of $g(x)$ is in the domain of $f(x)$.

#### Inverse Functions:
* An inverse function to a function is like what addition is to subtraction.
* **Definition**: A function $g(x)$ is the inverse of function $f$ if $g(f(x))=x$ for every $x$ in the domain of $f(x)$, and $f(g(x))=x$ for every $x$ in the domain of $g(x)$.
* The graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the same as $f(x)$ but reflected about the line $y=x$.
* To test the invertibility of a function, do the horizontal line test, where every $y$ must have a unique $x$.
* To get an inverse function, one must:
	1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$
	2. Interchange $x$ and $y$
	3. Solve for $y$
	4. Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$
	5. Exchange domain and range
