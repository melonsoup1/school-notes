# Coordinate Geometry

#### Distance Formula (between two points): $$\sqrt{(y_2-y_1)^2+(x_2+x_1)^2}=d$$

#### Distance Formula (between a point and a line): $$\frac{|ax_1+bx_2+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=d$$

#### Midpoint Formula: $$(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})=m$$

# Conic Sections

#### Circles: 

 * Standard Equation: $$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$$
 * Where $(h, k)$ is the center and $(x, y)$ is a point on the circle.

#### Parabolas:

* Standard Equation (vertical): $$(y-k)=\frac{1}{4p}(x-h)^2$$
* Standard Equation (horizontal): $$(x-h)=\frac{1}{4p}(y-k)^2$$
* Where $(h, k)$ is the vertex, $p$ is the distance between the vertex and the focus/directrix, and $(x, y)$is a point on the parabola.

#### Ellipses:

* Standard Equation (vertical): $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}=1$$
* Standard Equation (horizontal): $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1$$
* Formula for $c$: $$a^2=b^2+c^2$$
* Eccentricity Formula: $$\frac{c}{a}=e$$
* Constants: $$a>c$$ $$a>b$$
* Where $(h, k)$ is the center, $a$ is the major axis, $b$ is the minor axis, and $c$ is the distance from the vertex to the foci.
* The major axis is the distance from the center to the vertices (farther), and the minor axis is the distance from the center to the co-vertices (closer).
* The eccentricity of a ellipse is a measure of how far it is from a circle, higher being further, represented by $e$.

#### Hyperbolas

* Standard Equation (vertical): $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1$$ $$y-k=\pm\frac{a}{b}(x-h)$$
* Standard Equation (horizontal): $$\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}=1$$ $$y-k=\pm\frac{b}{a}(x-h)$$
* Formula for $c$: $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$
* Eccentricity Formula: $$\frac{c}{a}=e$$
* Where $(h, k)$ is the center, $a$ is the transverse axis, $b$ is the distance from a vertex to one of its corresponding asymptotes, which will be perpendicular to the transverse axis, and $c$ is the distance from a focus to the center.
* The transverse axis is the distance between a vertex and the center, represented by $a$.
* The conjugate axis is the line perpendicular to the transverse axis that passes through the center.
* The distance between a focus and the center is represented by $c$.
