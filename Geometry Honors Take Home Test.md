#### Problem 1 Proof:
In the diagram, I am given the triangle $\triangle{RHM}$, that the points of tangency of its incircle are points $B$, $E$, and $G$, and that all other points are the tangent points of its 3 excircles. I have to prove that segments $\overleftrightarrow{BR}$, $\overleftrightarrow{DH}$, and $\overleftrightarrow{FM}$ are concurrent.

I will start by noting that, to finish, we can also prove that $\frac{MD}{DR}\cdot\frac{RF}{FH}\cdot\frac{HB}{BM}=1$, as by the converse of Ceva's theorem, we would be done. 

First off, by the ice cream cone theorem, we can observe that: $$\frac{MD}{DR}\cdot\frac{RF}{FH}\cdot\frac{HB}{BM}=\frac{MD}{RS}\cdot\frac{RA}{FH}\cdot\frac{HE}{BM}$$
Next, by the semiperimeter theorems 130 and 131, we can substitute like so: $$\frac{MD}{RS}\cdot\frac{RA}{FH}\cdot\frac{HE}{BM}=\frac{MD}{s-h}\cdot\frac{s-m}{FH}\cdot\frac{s-h}{s-m}$$
After cancelling, we are left with $\frac{MD}{FH}$, and after applying the semiperimeter theorem 132, we can substitute again and get this: $$\frac{MD}{FH}=\frac{s}{s}=1$$
Circling back, we have just proved that $\frac{MD}{DR}\cdot\frac{RF}{FH}\cdot\frac{HB}{BM}=1$, and by the converse of Ceva's theorem, we are done. Q.E.D.
