#### Problem 1 Proof:
In the diagram, I am given the triangle $\triangle{RHM}$, that the points of tangency of its incircle are points $B$, $E$, and $G$, and that all other points are the tangent points of its 3 excircles. I will prove that segments $\overleftrightarrow{BR}$, $\overleftrightarrow{DH}$, and $\overleftrightarrow{FM}$ are concurrent.

I will start by noting that, to finish, we can also prove that $\frac{MD}{DR}\cdot\frac{RF}{FH}\cdot\frac{HB}{BM}=1$, as by the converse of Ceva's theorem, we would be done. 

First off, by the ice cream cone theorem, we can observe that: $$\frac{MD}{DR}\cdot\frac{RF}{FH}\cdot\frac{HB}{BM}=\frac{MD}{RS}\cdot\frac{RA}{FH}\cdot\frac{HE}{BM}$$
Next, by the semiperimeter theorems 130 and 131, we can substitute like so: $$\frac{MD}{RS}\cdot\frac{RA}{FH}\cdot\frac{HE}{BM}=\frac{MD}{s-h}\cdot\frac{s-m}{FH}\cdot\frac{s-h}{s-m}$$
After cancelling, we are left with $\frac{MD}{FH}$, and after applying the semiperimeter theorem 132, we can substitute again and conclude: $$\frac{MD}{FH}=\frac{s}{s}=1$$
Circling back, we have just proved that $\frac{MD}{DR}\cdot\frac{RF}{FH}\cdot\frac{HB}{BM}=1$, and by the converse of Ceva's theorem, we are done. Q.E.D. 

#### Problem 2:
I am given that $\frac{HK}{HD}=\frac{5}{6}$ and $\frac{EF}{ED}=\frac{1}{5}$.

**Part A:**
In triangle $\triangle{KDF}$, points $H$, $E$, and $B$ are collinear and are on each side of the triangle, so I can use Menelaus' theorem and arrive upon this: $$\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{5}{1}\cdot\frac{BF}{BK}=1\longrightarrow\frac{25}{6}\cdot\frac{BF}{BK}=1\longrightarrow\frac{BF}{BK}=\frac{6}{25}$$
In $\triangle{BKD}$, cevians $\overline{BH}$, $\overline{DF}$, and $\overline{KC}$ are concurrent at point $E$, so I can use Ceva's theorem and conclude this: $$\frac{6}{5}\cdot\frac{19}{6}\cdot\frac{BC}{CD}=1\longrightarrow\frac{25}{6}\cdot\frac{BF}{BK}=1\longrightarrow\frac{BF}{BK}=\frac{6}{25}$$
**Part B:**


#### Problem 3 Proof:
In the diagram, I am given that points $O$, $G$, and $H$ are the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter, respectively, of $\triangle{ABC}$. I am also given that $\overline{PQ}$ is a diameter of the circumcircle of $\triangle{ABC}$ and that $\overleftrightarrow{PG}$ intersects $\overline{HQ}$ at point $M$. I will prove that $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{HQ}$.

I will begin by quoting the given that $O$, $G$, and $H$ are the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter. This given means that the segment $\overline{HO}$ is the Euler Line in $\triangle{ABC}$, containing $G$, so $O$, $G$, and $H$ are collinear. We can also observe that
