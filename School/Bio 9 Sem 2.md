#### RNA Transcription and Translation
* **Transcription** 
	* the process of transforming DNA into RNA
	* takes place in the nucleus
	* Initiation
		* RNA Polymerase, the transcription enzyme, binds to a sequence of DNA called the promoter, found near the beginning of a gene
		* Promoter signals start of transcription, each gene has its own promoter
		* Once bound, RNA polymerase separates the DNA strands providing the single-stranded template
	* Elongation
		* one strand of DNA acts as a template for RNA polymerase
		* RNA polymerase will build a RNA molecule out of complementary nucleotides, making a strand that grows from 5' to 3'
		* the mRNA will look like the non-template strand of DNA, but thymine will be replaced with uracil
	* Termination
		* sequences called terminators signal that the RNA transcript is complete
		* once they are transcribed, they cause the mRNA to be released from the RNA polymerase
* **Translation**
	* turning RNA into polypeptides (proteins)
	* done by ribosomes in the cytoplasm
	* Initiation
		* a ribosome binds to mRNA, reaches start codon and begins translating
		* anything before the start codon will not be translated
	* Elongation
		* tRNA deposits amino acids, peptide bonds link amino acids together
	* Termination
		* ribosome reaches a stop codon, protein released
	* mRNA codon in the A site of the ribosome
	* amino acids are joined to make a polypeptide
	* must fold to become a functioning protein
	* mRNA is read in chunks of three called codons
	* introns: DNA sequences does not code for proteins
	* exons: DNA sequences codes for proteins
	* introns cut out by enzymes and exons spliced back together
	* tRNA has one anticodon with amino acid on top

#### DNA and RNA Mutations
* changes in the sequence of DNA
* harmful - disease/deformities
* helpful - organism adaptations to environment, better able to survive
* neutral - no change
* **Base Substitution (point mutation)**: changes an individual nitrogenous base
	* Silent Mutation - no effect
	* Missense Mutation - call for wrong amino acid, which could cause the protein to change shape, possible creating a useless protein
	* Nonsense Mutation - creates a stop codon where there shouldn't be one, polypeptide synthesis ceases
* **Base Insertion or Deletion (frameshit mutation):** add or delete a nitrogenous base
	* Frameshift Insertion - a nitrogenous base is inserted, causing a major difference in the amino acid sequence
	* Frameshift Deletion - a nitrogenous base is deleted, causing a major difference in the amino acid sequence
* **Causes of Mutations**:
	* errors during DNA replication
	* errors during chromosome crossovers
	* mutagen - physical and chemical agents
		* X-rays, ultraviolet light, radiation

#### Mitosis and Meiosis
**Mitosis:** the splitting of replicated DNA equally between 2 identical daughter cells
* ***Prophase**
	* Nuclear membrane breaking apart
	* DNA chromatin $\rightarrow$ chromosome form
	* Centrioles start to grow spindle fibers
* **Metaphase**
	* Chromosomes migrate to the equator (middle line) of the cell
	* Centrioles move to the poles (opposite ends) of the cell
	* Spindle fibers grow from centrioles and attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes
* **Anaphase**
	* Spindles retract back towards the centrioles and bring 1 sister chromatid with it (1 sister chromatid towards 1 centriole, 1 sister chromatid towards the other centriole)
* **Telophase**
	* Nuclear membrane reforms around the DNA 
	* DNA chromasomes $\rightarrow$ chromatin
	* Cell membrane pinches in on itself or cell plate
	* Spindle fibers retract, centrioles return to original plate in the cell 
* **Cytokinesis**
	* Splitting of the cytoplasm and seperation of the two daughter cells
