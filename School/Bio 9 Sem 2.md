#### RNA Transcription and Translation
* **Transcription** 
	* the process of transforming DNA into RNA
	* takes place in the nucleus
	* Initiation
		* RNA Polymerase, the transcription enzyme, binds to a sequence of DNA called the promoter, found near the beginning of a gene
		* Promoter signals start of transcription, each gene has its own promoter
		* Once bound, RNA polymerase separates the DNA strands providing the single-stranded template
	* Elongation
		* one strand of DNA acts as a template for RNA polymerase
		* RNA polymerase will build a RNA molecule out of complementary nucleotides, making a strand that grows from 5' to 3'
		* the mRNA will look like the non-template strand of DNA, but thymine will be replaced with uracil
	* Termination
		* sequences called terminators signal that the RNA transcript is complete
		* once they are transcribed, they cause the mRNA to be released from the RNA polymerase
* **Translation**
	* turning RNA into polypeptides (proteins)
	* done by ribosomes in the cytoplasm
	* Initiation
		* a ribosome binds to mRNA, reaches start codon and begins translating
		* anything before the start codon will not be translated
	* Elongation
		* tRNA deposits amino acids, peptide bonds link amino acids together
	* Termination
		* ribosome reaches a stop codon, protein released
	* mRNA codon in the A site of the ribosome
	* amino acids are joined to make a polypeptide
	* must fold to become a functioning protein
	* mRNA is read in chunks of three called codons
	* introns: DNA sequences does not code for proteins
	* exons: DNA sequences codes for proteins
	* introns cut out by enzymes and exons spliced back together
	* tRNA has one anticodon with amino acid on top

#### DNA and RNA Mutations
* changes in the sequence of DNA
* harmful - disease/deformities
* helpful - organism adaptations to environment, better able to survive
* neutral - no change
* **Base Substitution (point mutation)**: changes an individual nitrogenous base
	* Silent Mutation - no effect
	* Missense Mutation - call for wrong amino acid, which could cause the protein to change shape, possible creating a useless protein
	* Nonsense Mutation - creates a stop codon where there shouldn't be one, polypeptide synthesis ceases
* **Base Insertion or Deletion (frameshit mutation):** add or delete a nitrogenous base
	* Frameshift Insertion - a nitrogenous base is inserted, causing a major difference in the amino acid sequence
	* Frameshift Deletion - a nitrogenous base is deleted, causing a major difference in the amino acid sequence
* **Causes of Mutations**:
	* errors during DNA replication
	* errors during chromosome crossovers
	* mutagen - physical and chemical agents
		* X-rays, ultraviolet light, radiation

#### Mitosis and Meiosis
**Mitosis:** the splitting of replicated DNA equally between 2 identical daughter cells
* ***Prophase**
	* Nuclear membrane breaking apart
	* DNA chromatin $\rightarrow$ chromosome form
	* Centrioles start to grow spindle fibers
* **Metaphase**
	* Chromosomes migrate to the equator (middle line) of the cell
	* Centrioles move to the poles (opposite ends) of the cell
	* Spindle fibers grow from centrioles and attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes
* **Anaphase**
	* Spindles retract back towards the centrioles and bring 1 sister chromatid with it (1 sister chromatid towards 1 centriole, 1 sister chromatid towards the other centriole)
* **Telophase**
	* Nuclear membrane reforms around the DNA 
	* DNA chromasomes $\rightarrow$ chromatin
	* Cell membrane pinches in on itself or cell plate
	* Spindle fibers retract, centrioles return to original plate in the cell 
* **Cytokinesis**
	* Splitting of the cytoplasm and seperation of the two daughter cells

**Meiosis and Genetic Variation:**
* Both crossing-over and the random fertilization of gametes contribute to genetic variation in sexually reproducing organisms
* Independent assortment, the random distribution of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, contributes to genetic variation in sexually reproducing organisms
* Genetic variation is critical to the occurence of evolution

#### Reproductive Anatomy
**Definitions:**
- Genotypic male: XY
- Phenotypic male (for reproductive purposes)
	- penis, testes, sperm producing
- Genotypic female: XX
- Phenotypic female (for reproductive purposes)
	- vagina, uterus, ovaries, egg producing
- Biological mother - egg donor
- Biological father - sperm donor

**Production of the Sperm:**
Sperm cells are haploid and are produced in the seminiferous tubules within the testes. From the testes they are deposited into the epididymis where they mature and become mobile. Of the millions of sperm cells ejaculated into a female, only a few will survive to meet the egg a couple of days later. This is because the environment into which the sperm will enter is very harsh and the vast majority die:
* no energy source
* very acidic

#### Evolution
**Natural Selection:** the organisms best adapted to their environment will survive  

**Mechanisms of Evolution:**
* Natural Selection
	* Individuals with the best adapted phenotypes survive and pass on genes
	* Next generation: higher frequency of alleles for the better phenotype
* Mutation
	* A change in the DNA sequence
	* Mutations create new alleles, facilitating natural selection
* Genetic Drift
	* Allele frequency of a population changes unpredictably to due a random process
	* Bottleneck effect: Population shrinks then regrows
	* Founders effect: Migration of a small subgroup
* Gene Flow
	* Individuals move in or out of a population, causing changes in the gene pool
* Non-random mating
	* If individuals choose their mates, then more desirable alleles will have a higher frequency in future populations

**Species:** Group of organisms that interbreed to produce *fertile* offspring

**Speciation:** Formation of new species due to evolution

**How Speciation Occurs:**
* A lack of gene flow between populations is essential to create a difference in allele frequencies, phenotypes, and then possibly species
	* Prezygotic barriers
		* Habitat isolation
		* Temporal isolation (breeding at different times)
		* Behavioral isolation (different courtship rituals)
		* Mechanial isolation (incompatible reproductive parts)
		* Gametical isolation (incompatible gametes)
	* Postzygotic barriers
		* Reduced hybrid vitality (short-lived hybrids)
		* Reduced hybrid fertility (sterile hybrids)
		* Hybrid breakdown (fertile hybrids with sterile offspring)

**Allopatric Speciation:** Occurs when populations are separated by geological or physical barriers such as such as rivers, mountains, or bodies of water, causing geographic isolation.

**Sympatric Speciation:** Occurs when speciation occurs without a physical barrier possibly due to different food sources, mating seasons, behavioral differences or other habitat characteristics.

**Types of Reproductive Isolation:**
* Prezygotic
	* Ecological Isolation - very similar species may occupy different habitats in the same region
	* Behavioral Isolation - differences in behaviors, such as courtship rituals – usually mating rituals
	* Temporal Isolation - two species whose ranges overlap have different periods of sexual activity or breeding periods
	* Mechanical Isolation - morphological differences that prevent mating or pollination
	* Gametic Isolation- male gametes are unable to recognize and/or fertilize female gametes
* Postzygotic
	* Zygote Mortality – two animals are able to mate and fertilize a zygote, however it is unable to develop properly
	* Hybrid Inviabillty – hybrid dies early in development, or makes it to maturity but dies early in life
	* Hybrid Infertility – hybrid offspring mature to be adults but are infertile
