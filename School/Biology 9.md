# Chemistry
**Matter:** anything that has mass and takes up space.

#### States of Matter (that matter):
* Solid:
	* Definite shape
	* Particles vibrate
	* Definite volume
	* High density
* Liquid:
	* Takes shape of container
	* Definite volume
	* Particles vibrate and rotate
	* Density lower than solid
* Gas:
	* Takes shape of container
	* Takes volume of container
	* Particles rotate, vibrate, and travel
	* Low density


**Atom:** the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. Atoms consist of three subatomic particles: protons, which have a positive charge, neutrons, which have no charge, and electrons, which have a negative charge.

**Element:** substance that cannot be broken down further by normal chemical means.

**Atomic Number:** the number of protons in an element, this number is constant in each element. The number of protons in an atom is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom.

#### Elements of Living Things:
* ~25 elements are essential for human life.
* Four make up 96% of the weight of most living things (e.g. carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen).
* **Trace elements** are essential but are only needed in minute qualities (e.g. phosphorus, sulfur).

#### Chemical Bonds:
**Definition:** formed between the **valence electrons** of two atoms, elements are trying to create a "full set" of valence electrons by interacting with other elements.
* **Covalent Bond**
	* Formed by the sharing of one or more electron pairs between two atoms.
	* **Molecules:** formed when two or more atoms are held together by a covalent bond.
	* **Polar:** the unequal sharing of electrons, where one side of the molecule is positively charged while the other side is negatively charged.
	* **Nonpolar:** the equal sharing of electrons.
* **Ionic Bond**
	* Formed by the complete transfer of one or more electrons between atoms.
	* **Ion:** an atom that has gained or lost an electron.
* **Hydrogen Bond**
	* Intermolecular bonds formed between the partial positive charge of a hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partial negative charge found in a strong electronegative atom of another molecule.
	* Hydrogen bonds can only form between hydrogen and either oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine.

#### Acids and Bases:
**Acids:** molecules that generate protons ($H^+$ ions) in solution.

**Bases:** molecules that generate hydroxide ($OH^-$) ions in solution.

**pH Scale:** a scale used to describe how acidic or basic a solution is. A low pH ($<7$) indicates an acidic solution, and a high pH ($>7$) indicates basic solution. The formula for pH is: $$pH=-log[H^+]$$

This is caused by the fact that pH is the ratio of acids to bases in an solvent, and you have to take the negative log of a fraction to get a positive integer, which is your pH measurement

**Ocean Acidification:** Carbon dioxide, which is naturally in the atmosphere, dissolves into seawater. Water and carbon dioxide combine to form carbonic acid ($\ce{H_2CO_3}$), a weak acid that breaks (or "dissociates") into hydrogen ions ($H^+$), and bicarbonate ions ($\ce{HCO_3^-}$). The amount of carbonic acid has increased over the past 150 years, and these changes in ocean chemistry can disrupt the entire marine food web.

# Biochemistry

**Definition:** chemical composition and reaction in living systems.

**Organic:** carbon containing compound.

**Inorganic:** not containing carbon.

**Macromolecules:**
* Carbohydrates
* Lipids
* Proteins
* Nucleic acids

**Hydrocarbon:** contains carbon and hydrogen.

**Functional Groups:**
* Carboxyl
$$\ce{O=C-HO}$$
* Amino group
$$\ce{H-C-H}$$
* Methyl group
* $$\ce{~C-H-H-H}
