# Chemistry
**Matter:** anything that has mass and takes up space.

#### States of Matter (that matter):
* Solid:
	* Definite shape
	* Particles vibrate
	* Definite volume
	* High density
* Liquid:
	* Takes shape of container
	* Definite volume
	* Particles vibrate and rotate
	* Density lower than solid
* Gas:
	* Takes shape of container
	* Takes volume of container
	* Particles rotate, vibrate, and travel
	* Low density


**Atom:** the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. Atoms consist of three subatomic particles: protons, which have a positive charge, neutrons, which have no charge, and electrons, which have a negative charge.

**Element:** substance that cannot be broken down further by normal chemical means.

**Atomic Number:** the number of protons in an element, this number is constant in each element. The number of protons in an atom is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom.

#### Elements of Living Things:
* ~25 elements are essential for human life.
* Four make up 96% of the weight of most living things (e.g. carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen).
* **Trace elements** are essential but are only needed in minute qualities (e.g. phosphorus, sulfur).

#### Chemical Bonds:
**Definition:** formed between the **valence electrons** of two atoms, elements are trying to create a "full set" of valence electrons by interacting with other elements.
* **Covalent Bond**
	* Formed by the sharing of one or more electron pairs between two atoms.
	* **Molecules:** formed when two or more atoms are held together by a covalent bond.
	* **Polar:** the unequal sharing of electrons, where one side of the molecule is positively charged while the other side is negatively charged.
	* **Nonpolar:** the equal sharing of electrons.
* **Ionic Bond**
	* Formed by the complete transfer of one or more electrons between atoms.
	* **Ion:** an atom that has gained or lost an electron.
* **Hydrogen Bond**
	* Intermolecular bonds formed between the partial positive charge of a hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partial negative charge found in a strong electronegative atom of another molecule.
	* Hydrogen bonds can only form between hydrogen and either oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine.

#### Acids and Bases:
**Acids:** molecules that generate protons ($\ce{H^+}$ ions) in solution.

**Bases:** molecules that generate hydroxide ($\ce{OH^-}$) ions in solution.

**pH Scale:** a scale used to describe how acidic or basic a solution is. A low pH ($<7$) indicates an acidic solution, and a high pH ($>7$) indicates basic solution. The formula for pH is: $$pH=-log[H^+]$$

**Ocean Acidification:** Carbon dioxide, which is naturally in the atmosphere, dissolves into seawater. Water and carbon dioxide combine to form carbonic acid ($\ce{H2CO3}$), a weak acid that breaks (or "dissociates") into hydrogen ions ($\ce{H^+}$), and bicarbonate ions ($\ce{HCO3^-}$). The amount of carbonic acid has increased over the past 150 years, and these changes in ocean chemistry can disrupt the entire marine food web.

# Biochemistry

**Definition:** chemical composition and reaction in living systems.

**Organic:** carbon containing compound.

**Inorganic:** not containing carbon.

#### Macromolecules:
* Carbohydrates (starch)
* Lipids (triacylglycerol)
* Proteins (enzyme)
* Nucleic acids (DNA)

**Hydrocarbon:** contains carbon and hydrogen.

**Functional Group:** Groups of atoms attached to carbon skeletons that give molecules their unique properties. Some functional groups include:
* Hydroxyl group ($\ce{-OH}$)
* Carbonyl group ($\ce{--C=O}$)
* Carboxyl group ($\ce{-COOH}$)
* Amino group ($\ce{-NH2}$)
* Phosphate group ($\ce{-OPO3^2-}$)
* Methyl group ($\ce{-CH3}$)

**Polymer Formation:** Large molecules that are made of repeating building blocks (monomers) that are connected together during polymerization

**Life's Backbone:** Most of the compounds that make up living things contain carbon. In fact, carbon makes up the basic structure, or "backbone," of these compounds. Each atom of carbon forms four bonds with other atoms, including other carbons, making it capable of forming very large molecules.

**Carbohydrates:**
* Composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in an $1:2:1$ ratio.
* Simply put, they are "sugars":
	* Sugars are the major energy storage molecules for living organisms.
	* Simple sugars are known as monosaccharides.
	* Sugars composed of two simple sugars are called disaccharides
	* Complex carbohydrates, or polysaccharides, are made by combining more and more simple sugars.
* Carbohydrates function as:
	* dietary staple in most parts of the world – sugar and starch
	* energy storage - glucose, glycogen, starch
	* structural components in cells 
	* chitin in the exoskeleton of insects and other arthropods.
	* cellulose in plants - support
	* biochemical markers on the surface of plasma cells (a type of immune cell that makes large amounts of a specific antibody)
